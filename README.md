# Talos Bootstrap

Talos Bootstrap is an automated bootstrapping and configuration tool for deploying [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) clusters once they have been provisioned. The repository is structured as follows:

- [`clusters`](clusters) contains the bootstrap configuration for various clusters, each in their own file. Create a new file here to configure a new cluster. Take a look at [`clusters/example.yaml`](clusters/example.yaml) for the configuration schema.
- [`patch`](patch) contains the various strategic merge patches that are applied to the machine configurations of nodes as instrumented by the configurations in `clusters`. Take a look at [`example.yaml`](patch/example.yaml) for detailed information about the patch format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The bootstrap configuration file schema is intentionally unstable. Upon updating `talos-bootstrap`, one might need to update existing cluster configuration files to match the new schema. However, the strict validation logic should help with pointing out issues, such as changed fields. When updating cluster configuration, please refer to [`clusters/example.yaml`](clusters/example.yaml), which will always comply with the current schema and describe the fields.

## Installation

Install `pipx` from your distribution's repositories, then simply run

```shell
pipx install ./bootstrap # or with -e to install in editable mode
```

This will register the tool as the command `bootstrap` (assuming the `pipx` installation directory is in your `PATH`).

> Check the available command line options with `bootstrap --help`.

## Using `bootstrap`

The [`bootstrap`](bootstrap.py) automates the end-to-end setup of a Talos Linux cluster. It only requires a set of un-configured Talos Linux nodes in a network with the proper DNS configuration. After choosing a cluster configuration from one of the available configurations in [`clusters`](clusters) and ensuring that the [secrets](#secrets) are present, bootstrapping the cluster is as easy as running

```shell
bootstrap clusters/<cluster>.yaml
```

and monitoring the progress. The `bootstrap` tool requires the `talosctl`, `helm`,`flux`, and `kubectl` binaries to be present in `$PATH`. First, it will use `talosctl` to generate a configuration for the cluster and to patch the nodes, then it will apply the [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) CNI networking layer using `helm`, after that it will use `flux` to install [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) and (optionally) point it to the upstream defined in the cluster configuration, and finally it will apply any static manifests in the form of a [Kustomization](https://kustomize.io/) using `kubectl`. If a SOPS GPG key is supplied in the cluster configuration, `kubectl` is also used to create the SOPS secret in the `flux-system` namespace before installing Flux.

## Secrets

The bootstrapping process requires one or two files with secrets: a `secrets.yaml` which contains the secrets for `talosctl` and the cluster and, if configured, a `flux.key` which contains an SSH private key that Flux will use to access the configuration repository. The expected location of these files (in the `secrets` directory) is defined by the cluster configuration in `clusters`. Additionally, for SOPS, one can (optionally) provide a GPG ID/fingerprint of a key that can be imported into the cluster.

If you want to create new secrets for a cluster, do the following:

1. Create a new directory under `secrets` named after your cluster.
2. Enter that directory and run `talosctl gen secrets` to get a new `secrets.yaml`.
3. Run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f flux.key` to create a new private and public key for Flux.
4. Ensure that your cluster configuration under `clusters` uses the newly generated `secrets.yaml` and `flux.key`.
5. Create a new repository to host your service layer deployments.
6. Add the public key in `flux.key.pub` to the `Repository settings > Access keys` (or similar) of that repository.
7. Create a SOPS GPG key:
   ```
   gpg --batch --full-gen-key << EOF
   %no-protection
   Key-Type: EdDSA
   Key-Curve: Ed25519
   Key-Usage: sign
   Subkey-Type: ECC
   Subkey-Curve: Curve25519
   Subkey-Usage: encrypt
   Expire-Date: 0
   Name-Comment: Flux SOPS Key
   Name-Real: my-cluster.example.com
   EOF
   ```
8. Proceed with the [bootstrapping process](#using-bootstrap).
